<pattern>WHAT IS CHRISTMAS</pattern>
<template>
A holiday on December 25 celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ.It's very tough for us in the northern climes to imagine Mary and Joseph trudging to Bethlehem in anything but, as Christina Rosetti memorablydescribed it, "the bleak mid-winter," surrounded by "snow on snow on snow." To us, Christmas and December are inseparable. But for the first three centuries of Christianity, Christmas wasn't in Decemberï¿½or on the calendar anywhere.If observed at all, the celebration of Christ's birth was usually lumped in with Epiphany (January 6), one of the church's earliest established feasts. Some church leaders even opposed the idea of a birth celebration. Origen (c.185-c.254) preached that it would be wrong to honor Christ in the same way Pharaoh and Herod were honored. Birthdays were for pagan gods.Not all of Origen's contemporaries agreed that Christ's birthday shouldn't be celebrated, and some began to speculate on the date (actual records were apparently long lost). Clement of Alexandria (c.150-c.215) favored May 20 but noted that others had argued for April 18, April 19, and May 28. Hippolytus (c.170-c.236) championed January 2. November 17, November 20, and March 25 all had backers as well. A Latin treatise written around 243 pegged March 21, because that was believed to be the date on which God created the sun. Polycarp (c.69-c.155) had followed the same line of reasoning to conclude that Christ's birth and baptism most likely occurred on Wednesday, because the sun was created on the fourth day.The eventual choice of December 25, made perhaps as early as 273, reflects a convergence of Origen's concern about pagan gods and the church's identification of God's son with the celestial sun. December 25 already hosted two other related festivals: natalis solis invicti (the Roman "birth of the unconquered sun"), and the birthday of Mithras, the Iranian "Sun of Righteousness" whose worship was popular with Roman soldiers. The winter solstice, another celebration of the sun, fell just a few days earlier. Seeing that pagans were already exalting deities with some parallels to the true deity, church leaders decided to commandeer the date and introduce a new festival.Western Christians first celebrated Christmas on December 25 in 336, after Emperor Constantine had declared Christianity the empire's favored religion. Eastern churches, however, held on to January 6 as the date for Christ's birth and his baptism. Most easterners eventually adopted December 25, celebrating Christ's birth on the earlier date and his baptism on the latter, but the Armenian church celebrates his birth on January 6. Incidentally, the Western church does celebrate Epiphany on January 6, but as the arrival date of the Magi rather than as the date of Christ's baptism.Another wrinkle was added in the sixteenth century when Pope Gregory devised a new calendar, which was unevenly adopted. The Eastern Orthodox and some Protestants retained the Julian calendar, which meant they celebrated Christmas 13 days later than their Gregorian counterparts. Mostï¿½but not allï¿½of the Christian world now agrees on the Gregorian calendar and the December 25 date.The pagan origins of the Christmas date, as well as pagan origins for many Christmas customs (gift-giving and merrymaking from Roman Saturnalia; greenery, lights, and charity from the Roman New Year; Yule logs and various foods from Teutonic feasts), have always fueled arguments against the holiday. "It's just paganism wrapped with a Christian bow," naysayers argue. But while kowtowing to worldliness must always be a concern for Christians, the church has generally viewed efforts to reshape cultureï¿½including holidaysï¿½positively. As a theologian asserted in 320, "We hold this day holy, not like the pagans because of the birth of the sun, but because of him who made it."

<template>
<random>  <li>Druid.</li>  <li>I was raised as a Druid.   What are you?</li>  <li>The word Druidism is used today as a general name for the Celtic religious class of people. Actually, a druid was but one of the members of this Order of the Wise, as I prefer to call the group as a whole (taken from Morgan Llewelyn's book The Druids). The Order of the Wise consisted of the bards, the vates, and the druids.The functions of each of these three members of the Order of the Wise was very well defined, and each served the same purpose: To protect, guide, and ensure the survival of the tribe. There is also some dispute as to whether or not these three classes were separate from another or if they were steps in a training program to become a Druid.I feel that the answer is two-fold. First, these divisions were most likely steps in an initiate's training to becoming a member of the Order of the Wise. Each had to have at least a basic understanding of one another in order to function most productively within the tribe. Of course, during the course of training, many of the things learned by the initiate would overlap with one another and an initiate's training was likely not viewed as hierarchical in nature (druids better than vates better than bards).Secondly, these three divisions would refer to what area of the Order of the Wise a person wished to devote themselves to after they had become a member of the Order of the Wise. This distinction was also probably not viewed as hierarchical since each was vital to the survival of the tribe.The Gaulish word bardos (plural bardi) possibly comes from the PIE root *gWer- ("to favor"), which would give bardos a meaning of "one who praises". According to Diodorus, the bardi were "lyric poets" and they "sing to the accompaniment of instruments which are like lyres, and their songs may be either of praise or insult" (Book V.31). Thus, we can view the bards as the repositories of all the knowledge of the tribe - the customs, beliefs, and traditions that enabled the survival of the tribe. This vital task was achieved and maintained through oral memorization of poems that would have contained this information.The bards were also the poets and singers of the tribe, singing myths about the Gods and epics about the heroes and heroines of the tribe. The way that the ancient bards would have told their myths and epics is probably not unlike the way in which other oral cultures did: The bard would have learned such oral poetic devices as formulas and themes in his/her training, and would utilize them when composing a song. Inside the bard's memory was stored everything of importance to the tribe.This gathering and storing of information allowed a druid initiate to have a firm foundation upon which the other knowledgehe/she would acquire in their training would build upon. In modern Druidism, the bards are associated with the realm of Seaand the Ancestors. The Gaulish word vatis (plural vates) comes from the PIE root *wet- ("to blow, inspire, spiritually arouse"), which would give vatis a meaning of "one who is inspired".Diodorus describes the vates as "diviners" who "foretell the future by means of of the flight or cries of birds and of the slaughter of sacred animals" (Book V.31). The vates were the diviners and omen-readers of the tribe. No actions, whether religious or public, could be taken without the auspices being taken by the vates, and the auspices must be favorable in order for the action to be taken. The vates were also the healers of the tribe. A vates training allowed a druid initiateto gain an understanding of magic and how magic worked.This foundation in magic, along with the bardic foundation in customs, beliefs, and traditions of the tribe, allowed a druid initiate to become a druid. In modern Druidism, the vates, because of their use of magic, are associated with the realm of Earth and the Nature Spirits. The Gaulish word druis (plural druides) is of obscure origins and has caused much debate among both scholars and modern druids. The only positive element of the word is the root "(u)id", which comes from the PIE root *-weid, which means "to see", and subsequently "to know" (PIE root *wid-).Pliny the Elder derived the first element of the word from the Greek word drus, meaning "an oak". This etymology would givethe word druis a meaning of "knower of the oak" or, more commonly, "seer of the oak". It is this etymology that has led to many misconceptions about Druids, namely that they worship oak trees. However, the more likely etymology is that the first part of the word is from the PIE root *deru- ("to be firm, solid"), which would give the word druis a meaning of "a very wise/intelligent person", i.e. a person that knows a lot.Although the PIE root *deru- is connected to many words meaning "a tree" and the Greek word drus, it is highly unlikely that druis contains this meaning because the Gaulish word for oak is deruo- and the root *dru- is an intensive prefix in the other Celtic languages. However, given the Celtic tendency for riddles and double meanings, the word druis may have had connatations with the word for "tree" or "oak", but this should probably not be interpretted as they "worshipped the oak tree" or were "tree huggers", and merely that they looked to Nature as a source for understanding and gaining knowledge.Diodorus describes the druides as "philosophers" and "learned in religious affairs" (Book V.31). Thus, the druids were the religious practitioners, ritual performers, teachers, advisers, and problem-solvers of the tribe. In the druid was combinedboth the learning of the bards and vates, and the druid also knew how to use these skills for the benefit of the tribe. The druids were also the advisers to the chieftains of the tribes, and for this reason, commanded great respect and power within their own tribe and within other tribes.A druid initiate's training could take as long as twenty years (according to Caesar), and when the training was complete, the initiate would become a druid, but he/she could probably focus on any aspect of Druidism that they wished. For example,one person might choose to be a bard, another might choose to be a healer, and another might choose to be a teacher.Part of becoming a Druid meant that the initiate knew and understood their own place within the tribe and how they could most benefit the tribe. If a Druid did not know this, or if the Druid was only seeking power over others, then that person was not a Druid and had no place in Druidism. This fact is still true in modern day Druidism. The Order of the Wise - bards, vates, and druids - worked as a whole to protect, guide, and ensure the survival of the tribe.</li></random>

Some believe that the first book written was the Bible and the first writings of what we now call the Hebrew Bible werewritten down around 700BC.  There are many Greek and Egyptian writings much older than that.  The first permanent writingswere probably put down on hide with ochre and charcoal.  They were most likely maps.  Is a map a book?  Probably not.  But,a collection of maps (now called an atlas) would have been useful to early nomadic travelers.
